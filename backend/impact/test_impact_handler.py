"""
Module to test the functionality of the ImpactHandler class.

This module contains unit tests for the methods defined in the ImpactHandler class.
It includes tests for calculating impact function sets, retrieving impact function IDs,
calculating impacts, and generating impact GeoJSON files.

Classes:
- `TestImpactHandler`: Unit tests for the ImpactHandler class.

Methods:
- `test_calculate_impact_function_set`: Tests the method for calculating impact function sets.
- `test_get_impf_id`: Tests the method for retrieving impact function IDs.
- `test_calculate_impact`: Tests the method for calculating impacts.
- `test_generate_impact_geojson`: Tests the method for generating impact GeoJSON files.
